# restore-missing-extensions
Restores extensions to selected files missing extensions, using the [fine free file utility](http://www.darwinsys.com/file) (included in OS X).

Does not yet use file's new ext property as its implementation is mostly incomplete.

Grab a usable copy from [Releases](../../releases).
